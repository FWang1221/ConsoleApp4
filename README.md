Hopefully I got everyone, if you felt like you were part of this project's creation just ping me on Discord or something and I'll add you.

*new player miniheader stuff isn't that great but I did change the object for it, requires slightly edited TAE.Animation.CS from SAP but I need to find out how to get it.
