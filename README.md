Purpose: Many mods for Elden Ring, such as 

Sword Mastery (https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/1890), 
Call of the Abyss/Garden of Eyes/Faded Burn/Other Anime Movesets, 
Moveset Animation Remix's (https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/920),
and Clever's Moveset Modpack (https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/1928)

feature greatly enhanced player speeds, however they do not enhance enemy speeds to compensate, leading to a fundamental balancing disparity. This is made worse by the fact that enemies in Elden Ring frequently have long delays. This tool (? Sort of a tool?) aims to fix that by providing easy speed-up gradients to the start of enemy attacks and projectile spawns to make combat feel less one-sided.

Instructions: Open the Program.cs in Visual Studio, click "Run", and follow the instructions on the Console.

Many thanks to the following...
