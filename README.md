Many thanks to the following...

Created with great help from Nordgaren (who wrote ~50% of the code and helped me learn Visual Studio) and Gomp-DS (whose GetRumbleCamIds https://github.com/GompDS/GetRumbleCamIds project was used as a base for this project).

Meowmaritus for providing SoulsAssetPipeline (https://github.com/Meowmaritus/SoulsAssetPipeline), and for tips and tricks on other TAE-related things.

AinTunez, whose fork (https://github.com/AinTunez/RoguelikeSouls) of Grimrukh's Roguelike Souls (https://github.com/Grimrukh/RoguelikeSouls) I dissected as reference material.

JKAnderson (and his crew's) SoulsFormats (https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats).

Hopefully I got everyone, if you felt like you were part of this project's creation just ping me on Discord or something and I'll add you.
